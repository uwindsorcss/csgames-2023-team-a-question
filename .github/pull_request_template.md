## Briefly explain how your solution works and how to run it 

My solution uses a backtracking solution which is pretty much brute force which goes through every cell to find a letter that matches with the word. The solution starts with the first letter of the word (if found) and then scopes the neighbours for a match without using the same letter cell.

To run it: make sure Python is installed and extensions are installed in Visual Studio Code. Click on the triangle in the upper right hand corner in Visual Studio Code and click on "Run Python File".

You can also type "py solution.py" to run it.
